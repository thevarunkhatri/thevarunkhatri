## A designer with a technical heart. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Varun Khatri, an interaction designer currently studying User Experience Design at the Savannah College of Art and Design.

To me, the appeal and gravitas of UX design is rooted in the principle that intentional design can dictate the human experience. This holds true regardless of the type of product it is. Recently, the video game industry has caught my attention because a video game in its entirety is meant to be an experience and it's the video game designer's job to make it an unforgettable one.

Beyond design, I spend my time reading whatever I can get my hands on whether it be fiction, non-fiction or comics. I occasionally write down my thoughts on a topic that has peaked my interested on Medium.
